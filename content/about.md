# Go can be f#!king hard

Every language has rough edges, and things that people find hard, even Go.  Go has some great docs, and plenty of answers on Stack Overflow, but sometimes a bit more context is needed, which is where **[golang.wtf](https://golang.wtf)** comes in, to _hopefully_ simplify complex ideas.

## Contributing

**golang.wtf** is 100% open source, and open for contributions via pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/wwsean08/wtfgo).  For new authors contributing their first post, make sure to include a yaml file under `data/authors` with your username to reference for the author information at the bottom of the post. 

## Inspiration

This website was inspired by [git.wtf](https://git.wtf), thanks Mandeep Singh and the contributors for creating such a great utility.
