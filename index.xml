File Naming The easiest way to build for a specific OS/Architecture is to append that information to the end of your filename, some examples include:
main_windows.go main_darwin.go main_darwin_arm64.go specific to ARM macs, like MacBook Pros with an M1 processor The order of these names must be GOOS_GOARCH, the other way around will not work, and of course they still require a name beyond this suffix.</description></item></channel></rss>
